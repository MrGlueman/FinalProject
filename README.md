# FinalProject

This site was created for educational purposes.  It is my final assignment for the Berkeley Extention Web Design with HTML5 AND CSS3 course.  The band Waterworks doesn't exist.

The images on About & Gallery pages include images from Pexels.com

The Music page includes music videos from Four Tet.

The home page uses an image from Shutterstock.com

The site uses code found on W3 Schools.

The overall site was created and designed by Robin E.
